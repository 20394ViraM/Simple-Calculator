\f0\fs24 \cf0 The following java application is a simple calculator a swing based framework containing most of the mathematical operations to perform.\
\
The first three columns contain all the buttons present in any simple calculator.\
The remaining three rows contain buttons to perform direct operations like logarithm, exponents, Square Root, Cube Root, Factorial, Permutation, Combination, and trigonometric function.\
\
Some operations need two value(like add, subtract, multiply, divide and wherever X and Y are mentioned) where are others requires only one value (percent, square root, trigonometric functions and wherever X is mentioned)\
\
The way to use :\
For single value:(value : operation )\
For double value:(value : operation : value :equal)\
\
However one can perform operations on the answer value directly after it is displayed.\
\
Pros: \
Contain more operations than a simple calculator.\
Can be used for one value as well as two value operation.\
The answer obtained can be again used in the next operation to perform.\
\
Cons:\
It performs one on one operations.\
BODMAS rule is not followed as it doesn\'92t take the whole equation. \
No Brackets.\
The trigonometric operations are performed in degrees and have no choice to change in radians.\
It has no option to go back to the previous answer.\
